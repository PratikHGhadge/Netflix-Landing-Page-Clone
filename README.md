## Description

This project is a static clone of the Netflix website's landing page, created using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates my front-end development skills in replicating the design and layout of the Netflix homepage.



## Key Features

- **CSS Flexbox and Grid:** I utilized CSS Flexbox and Grid to create a flexible and organized layout, closely resembling the original Netflix landing page.
- **Static Content:** As a static clone, the project focuses on presenting the visual design and layout of the Netflix homepage without functional back-end or streaming capabilities.

## Getting Started

To view the Netflix landing page clone locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
